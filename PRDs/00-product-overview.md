# ClarityAI — Product Overview

**Last updated:** February 2026

## What Is ClarityAI?

ClarityAI is a private, AI-powered executive coaching application. It helps leaders and professionals work through difficult decisions by guiding them to discover their own answers — not by telling them what to do.

The AI coach follows the principles of the **International Coaching Federation (ICF)**, meaning it asks thoughtful questions, surfaces hidden patterns, and helps users think more clearly rather than giving direct advice.

**Tagline:** *"Make the hard call with confidence, not regret."*

## Who Is It For?

- Senior leaders and executives facing high-stakes decisions
- Professionals navigating career crossroads (job changes, promotions, pivots)
- Anyone who wants a confidential, judgment-free space to think through a dilemma

## Core Value Proposition

| What We Offer | What That Means for the User |
|---|---|
| **Clarity, Not Confusion** | When the user's mind is racing with options, the AI coach helps untangle the noise and find the signal that matters. |
| **Your Values, Your Choice** | The app doesn't impose frameworks. It surfaces what's already important to the user, then helps them act on it with conviction. |
| **Confidential & Private** | The user's deepest career dilemmas stay between them and the screen. No judgment, no human ever sees their session. |

---

## How It Works (User Perspective)

The experience follows a simple three-step process:

1. **Share your dilemma** — In your own words, describe the decision weighing on you. No forms, no structure — just speak freely.
2. **Explore with precision** — The AI asks the questions a great coach would — uncovering blind spots, fears, and hidden priorities you hadn't considered.
3. **Arrive at clarity** — Walk away knowing not just *what* to do, but *why* it's right for you. The confidence stays long after the session ends.

A typical session takes about **15 minutes**.

## Application Pages

The application has two main areas:

| Page | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Landing Page** (Home) | A marketing website that explains the product, its value, and how it works. Contains calls to action to start a session. |
| **Session Page** | The coaching experience itself. Guides the user through sign-in, mental preparation, the AI coaching chat, and post-session feedback. |
